# Task 2: Get Data from api and display
1. Get a list of images whose “albumId” is 1 from this endpoint:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos using axios
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
2. Use latest bootstrap
3. Divide the window (html body) vertically in 2 containers (left and right)
4. Display the thumbnails (using “thumbnailUrl”) and titles of the images in a grid of 3
column ( in left container)
5. The thumbnails should be clickable. When a user clicks on a thumbnail, the selected
thumbnail should be displayed on the right container (using the value of “url” of the
selected thumbnail).
